# Excel-Automation-Project
This project demonstrates the use of Excel Macros and VBA to automate repetitive tasks and run Monte Carlo simulations.


##  ðŸ“Œ Overview 

This project showcases how to use Excel Macros and VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) to streamline repetitive processes and perform simulations efficiently within an Excel environment. It is a practical example for those interested in learning how VBA can extend Excelâ€™s capabilities, especially in data simulation and automation workflows.

It is designed as a practical example for those looking to understand how VBA can extend Excel's functionality, particularly in data simulation and automation workflows.

### ðŸŽ¥ Part 1: Reducing Manual Labor by Recording Macros
- Recorded the steps for copying input values from different sheets, running simulations, and pasting outputs into the results section.

- Edited the recorded macro to include a For loop, allowing automated execution across multiple worksheets.

- Abstracted the macro into a button, significantly reducing the time required for manual copy-paste and result recording.

### ðŸš„ Part 2: Writing the Monte Carlo Simulation and Improving Runtime
- Implemented a Monte Carlo simulation in VBA to model randomized outcomes based on defined parameters (e.g., return and risk assumptions).

- Used loops and randomized logic to generate thousands of simulation trials efficiently within Excel.

- Optimized runtime performance by disabling screen updating (Application.ScreenUpdating = False) and other non-essential processes during macro execution.

#### ðŸ§  Skills Demonstrated
- VBA macro recording and editing
- Loop structures and conditional logic in VBA
- Performance optimization in Excel
- Monte Carlo simulation modeling
- Process automation and UI abstraction

Disclaimer: This project is inspired by exercises from the TIA (The Infinite Actuary) VBA for Actuaries course.
